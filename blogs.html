      <p>For those philosophy geeks out there who are looking for a one-on-one debate, Lincoln Douglas debate is for you! Other than constraining speech times, there aren’t many rules in Lincoln Douglas debate. Regarding questions of what society should look like, Lincoln Douglas debaters will engage in various conversations, often taking a step back to evaluate how we should approach the resolution as a society before measuring its effects. Questions of morality and justice are examples of commonly explored dialogues. Resolutions typically involve declaring our moral obligations surrounding a specific scenario, allowing for debaters to talk about the implications of passing the resolution, question how we should approach improving society, or even if the resolution should be talked about at all. After competing in Lincoln Douglas, you’ll probably learn way too much about critical theorists and philosophers, and it’s a blast. However, if philosophy isn’t for you, don’t worry! Lincoln Douglas also allows debaters to propose their own policy or debate the resolution’s effects as they would happen in the real world.

At the start of the round, both debaters will greet their judge and the aff will begin the first speech of the round. Debaters are assigned which position they have to defend 10-30 minutes prior to the round, but can expect to debate both positions an even amount of times in any given tournament.
