<div id="LD" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Lincoln Douglas Debate</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
In this one-on-one format, students debate a topic provided by the Association. Lincoln-Douglas Debate topics 
range from individual freedom versus the collective good to economic development versus environmental protection. 
Students may consult evidence gathered prior to the debate but may not use the Internet in round. An entire 
debate is roughly 45 minutes and consists of constructive speeches, rebuttals, and cross-examination.

Considerations for Lincoln-Douglas Debate:
Lincoln-Douglas Debate typically appeals to individuals who like to debate, but prefer a one-on-one format as 
opposed to a team or group setting. Additionally, individuals who enjoy LD like exploring questions of how 
society ought to be. Many people refer to LD Debate as a “values” debate, as questions of morality and justice 
are commonly examined. Students prepare cases and then engage in an exchange of cross-examinations and rebuttals
in an attempt to convince a judge that s/he is the better debater in the round.
 
Current Topic:
September/October –
Resolved: In the United States, colleges and universities ought not consider standardized tests in undergraduate admissions decisions. 
  </pre>
</div>

<div id="PF" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Public Forum Debate</h3>
  <pre class = "schedule">
Public Forum Debate involves opposing teams of two, debating a topic concerning a current event. Proceeding a coin toss, the winners choose which
side to debate (PRO or CON) or which speaker position they prefer (1st or 2nd), and the other team receives the remaining option. Students present 
cases, engage in rebuttal and refutation, and also participate in a “crossfire” (similar to a cross-examination) with the opportunity to question the
opposing team. Often, community members are recruited to judge this event.

Considerations for Public Forum Debate:
As a team event, students who compete in Public Forum need to be able to work well with a partner. Balanced teams, both in terms of preparation
before debates and contributions within a debate, helps provide a competitive advantage during tournaments. PF is the newest form of debate in
the Association and looks at current event topics. Students who do Public Forum must be prepared to debate in front of judges without any formal
debate training. Being able to persuade a range of judges is a central component to this event. Additionally, PF is focused upon debating
varying resolutions that change frequently, which exposes students to a variety of topics during a singular competitive season.

Current Topic:
Resolved: The European Union should join the Belt and Road Initiative.
  </pre> 
</div>

<div id="Congress" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Congressional Debate</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
A simulation of the U.S. legislative process in the Senate and the House, students generate a series of bills and resolutions for debate in 
Congressional Debate. Debaters (also referred to as Senators and Representatives) alternate delivering speeches for and against the topic in a group 
setting. An elected student serves as a presiding officer to ensure debate flows smoothly. Students are assessed on their research, argumentation,
and delivery skills, as well as their knowledge and use of parliamentary procedure.

Considerations for Congressional Debate:
Students who do Congressional Debate are typically interested in learning about issues that are significant to the legislative process within the 
United States. Students are exposed to a deeper application of Robert’s Rules of Parliamentary Procedure. Students must prepare for debate on 
numerous topics in any given competition and be able to extend a long-lasting debate with unique and fresh ideas, as well as by refuting previous 
speakers on a specific topic.

Current Legislation can be found <a href="https://www.txfa.org/documents/2019-20/TFA%20Fall%202019%20Legislative%20Docket.pdf">here</a>

  </pre>
</div>

<div id="Extemp" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Extemporaneous Debate</h3>
  <pre class  = "schedule">
Event Description:
In Extemporaneous Speaking, students are presented with a choice of three questions related to current events in the U.S. or world and
in 30 minutes, prepare a seven-minute speech answering the selected question. Students may consult articles and evidence they gather prior
to the contest, but may not use the Internet during preparation. Topics range from political matters to economic concerns or social concerns. 
The speech is delivered from memory.

Considerations for United States Extemp:
Students who do Extemp are typically very curious about matters of interest. Students should be well read and understand current events. 
To learn more about domestic or international issues, students should spend significant time reading from a variety of news sources. 
  </pre>
</div>

<div id="Policy" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Policy Debate (CX)</h3>
  <pre class = "schedule">
A two-on-two debate that focuses on a policy question for the duration of the academic year. This debate format tests a student’s research, 
analytical, and delivery skills. Policy Debate generally involves the proposal of a plan or advocacy by the affirmative team, while the negative 
team offers reasons to reject that affirmative proposal. Throughout the debate, students have the opportunity to cross-examine one another. 
A judge or panel of judges determines the winner based on the arguments presented within the round.

Considerations for Policy Debate:
Students who do Policy Debate MUST be able to work well with a partner. Balanced hardworking teams, both in terms of preparation before debates
 and contributions within a debate, helps provide a competitive advantage during tournaments. Policy debaters are interested in examining specific 
 policies in an intricate and detailed manner. Depth of research is a common trait of successful Policy debaters. Policy Debate is commonly 
 viewed as the most technical debate event within the Association.

2019-2020 Topic:
Resolved: The United States federal government should substantially reduce Direct Commercial Sales and/or Foreign Military Sales of arms from the 
United States.
</pre>
</div>

<div id="OO" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Original Oratory</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
Students deliver a self-written, ten-minute speech on a topic of their choosing. Limited in their ability to quote words directly, Original Oratory
competitors craft an argument using evidence, logic, and emotional appeals. Topics range widely, and may be informative or persuasive in nature. 
The speech is delivered from memory.

Considerations for Selecting an OO Topic:
Students who write orations should think seriously about a topic that is of personal interest and significance to them. Given the number of weeks 
students may be doing Oratory, they will want to find a topic that they can keep fresh and engaging for extended periods of time. Additionally, 
orators should consider topics that are current and relatable to audience members. Oratory is an ongoing process! The last speech that is 
performed will never be a “final” draft. There is always room for revision, so pick a topic that you will enthusiastically explore and reflect upon 
during the season.
  </pre>
</div>

<div id="Prose" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Prose Interpretation</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">

Using short story, parts of a novel, or other published work of prose, students provide an interpretation of one or more selections with a 
time limit of seven minutes, including introduction. Typically a single piece of literature, Prose can be drawn from works of fiction or non-fiction. 
Prose corresponds to usual (ordinary/common) patterns of speech and may combine elements of narration and dialogue. 
Students may not use 
poetry, nor drama (plays), in this category. Students must use a manuscript in Prose, which typically consists of a small three-ring binder with 
page protectors. Reading from a book or magazine is prohibited.

Considerations for Selecting Prose Literature:
Students in Prose Interpretation may choose literature on topics that are serious, humorous, mysterious, thought- provoking -- the key is to 
choose Prose that works for the individual student. Non- ction publications, such as essays, articles, and biographies, or works of fiction, 
such as short stories and books, may be sources for Prose Interpretation. Considerations for an appropriate piece include the student’s personality, 
maturity, physical and vocal performance range, and school standards.
  </pre>
</div>
<div id="Poetry" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Poetry Interpretation</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
Using a selection or selections of literature, students provide an interpretation of Poetry with a time limit of seven minutes, including introduction. 
Poetry is characterized by writing that conveys ideas, experiences, and emotions through language and expression. Students may choose traditional 
poetry, often characterized by rhyme or rhythm, or nontraditional poetry, which often has a rhythmic flow but is not necessarily 
structured by formal meter (meter is a beat, pattern, or structure, such as iambic pentameter). Students may not use prose, nor drama (plays), in this 
category. Students must use a manuscript in Poetry, which typically consists of a small three-ring binder with page protectors. Reading from a book 
or magazine is prohibited.

 

Considerations for Selecting Poetry Literature:
Students in Poetry Interpretation may choose literature on topics that are serious, humorous, non-linear, ethereal, or thought-provoking -- the key is to 
choose Poetry that works for the individual student. Poetry collections, often referred to as anthologies, or a single long-form poem may be selected. 
Considerations for an appropriate piece include the student’s personality, maturity, physical and vocal performance range, and school standards.
  </pre>
</div>
<div id="HI" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Humorous Interpretation</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
Using a play, short story, or other published work, students perform a selection of one or more portions of a piece up to ten minutes in length. 
Humorous Interpretation is designed to test a student’s comedic skills through script analysis, delivery, timing, and character development. 
Competitors may portray one or multiple characters. No props or costumes may be used. Performances can also include an introduction written by 
the student to contextualize the performance and state the title and author.

 


Considerations for Selecting HI Literature:
When searching for literature, a student should look for more than one-liner jokes. Humor can be created through strategic choreography, 
creative characterization, and dynamic non-verbal reactions. Typical selection topics range from light-hearted material including interpretations 
of comics, children’s literature, plays, short stories, and more. Considerations for selecting an HI topic should include the student’s age, 
maturity, and school standards.
  </pre>
</div>
<div id="DI" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Dramatic Interpretation</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
Using a play, short story, or other published work, students perform a selection of one or more portions of a piece up to ten minutes in length.

dramatic text. Competitors may portray one or multiple characters. No props or costumes may be used. Performances may also include an 
introduction written by the student to contextualize the performance and state the title and author.

 

Considerations for Selecting DI Literature:
Students who do Dramatic Interpretation may perform selections on topics of serious social subject matter such as coping with terminal illness; 
significant historical situations, events, and figures; as well as racial and gender discrimination, suppression, and oppression. Students 
should select pieces that are appropriate for them. Considerations for selecting a DI topic should include the student’s age, maturity, and school 
standards.
