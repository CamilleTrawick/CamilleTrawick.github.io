<div id="LD" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Lincoln Douglas Debate</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
In this one-on-one format, students debate a topic provided by the Association. Lincoln-Douglas Debate topics 
range from individual freedom versus the collective good to economic development versus environmental protection. 
Students may consult evidence gathered prior to the debate but may not use the Internet in round. An entire 
debate is roughly 45 minutes and consists of constructive speeches, rebuttals, and cross-examination.

Considerations for Lincoln-Douglas Debate:
Lincoln-Douglas Debate typically appeals to individuals who like to debate, but prefer a one-on-one format as 
opposed to a team or group setting. Additionally, individuals who enjoy LD like exploring questions of how 
society ought to be. Many people refer to LD Debate as a “values” debate, as questions of morality and justice 
are commonly examined. Students prepare cases and then engage in an exchange of cross-examinations and rebuttals
in an attempt to convince a judge that s/he is the better debater in the round.
 
Current Topic:
September/October –
Resolved: In the United States, colleges and universities ought not consider standardized tests in undergraduate admissions decisions. 
  </pre>

<div id="PF" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Public Forum Debate</h3>
  <pre class = "schedule">
Public Forum Debate involves opposing teams of two, debating a topic concerning a current event. Proceeding a coin toss, the winners choose which
side to debate (PRO or CON) or which speaker position they prefer (1st or 2nd), and the other team receives the remaining option. Students present 
cases, engage in rebuttal and refutation, and also participate in a “crossfire” (similar to a cross-examination) with the opportunity to question the
opposing team. Often, community members are recruited to judge this event.

Considerations for Public Forum Debate:
As a team event, students who compete in Public Forum need to be able to work well with a partner. Balanced teams, both in terms of preparation
before debates and contributions within a debate, helps provide a competitive advantage during tournaments. PF is the newest form of debate in
the Association and looks at current event topics. Students who do Public Forum must be prepared to debate in front of judges without any formal
debate training. Being able to persuade a range of judges is a central component to this event. Additionally, PF is focused upon debating
varying resolutions that change frequently, which exposes students to a variety of topics during a singular competitive season.

Current Topic:
Resolved: The European Union should join the Belt and Road Initiative.
  </pre> 
</div>

<div id="Congress" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Congressional Debate</h3>
  <pre class="schedule">
A simulation of the U.S. legislative process in the Senate and the House, students generate a series of bills and resolutions for debate in 
Congressional Debate. Debaters (also referred to as Senators and Representatives) alternate delivering speeches for and against the topic in a group 
setting. An elected student serves as a presiding officer to ensure debate flows smoothly. Students are assessed on their research, argumentation,
and delivery skills, as well as their knowledge and use of parliamentary procedure.

Considerations for Congressional Debate:
Students who do Congressional Debate are typically interested in learning about issues that are significant to the legislative process within the 
United States. Students are exposed to a deeper application of Robert’s Rules of Parliamentary Procedure. Students must prepare for debate on 
numerous topics in any given competition and be able to extend a long-lasting debate with unique and fresh ideas, as well as by refuting previous 
speakers on a specific topic.

team offers reasons to reject that affirmative proposal. Throughout the debate, students have the opportunity to cross-examine one another. 
A judge or panel of judges determines the winner based on the arguments presented within the round.

 and contributions within a debate, helps provide a competitive advantage during tournaments. Policy debaters are interested in examining specific 
 policies in an intricate and detailed manner. Depth of research is a common trait of successful Policy debaters. Policy Debate is commonly
